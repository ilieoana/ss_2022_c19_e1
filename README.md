## üõ†Ô∏è What I Did

This project was implemented as part of my learning journey with Spring Security. I followed the tutorial closely and:

- Recreated the project from scratch in my local environment.
- Set up CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration using Spring Security 6.
- This lesson involves implementing CORS policies to enable controlled cross-origin requests between different domains.
- In achieving this, the following concepts were implemented:
    - CORS Configuration - Configuring allowed origins, methods, and headers for cross-origin requests;
    - Global CORS Settings - Setting up application-wide CORS policies using CorsConfigurationSource;
    - Endpoint-Specific CORS - Applying different CORS configurations to specific endpoints using @CrossOrigin
      annotation;
    - CORS Integration with Security - Ensuring CORS configuration works properly with Spring Security's authentication
      and authorization mechanisms.
